Perform the following tasks:

1. Create a clone of the Gen1 single node cluster.

2. Setup the hosts file as per the following spec:

	Hostname: mytask
	Hosts file: 
		IP_ADD	mytask

3. Start Hadoop Services and Upload the sample file in /taskdata/sample HDFS location.

4. Upgrade the Gen1 cluster to Gen2 cluster ensuring no data loss in HDFS location. Steps for the same will be provided.


5. Verify the data by displaying the data in the console.



Steps for Cluster Upgrade:
---------------------------

Hadoop Cluster Upgrade 
========================

Old Version Demo: hadoop-1.2.1
New Version Demo: hadoop-2.7.2

Scenario:

We need to upgrade the existing Hadoop cluster manually without altering the existing HDFS storage.




Hadoop HDFS upgrade
====================
0. Verify the current Hadoop version and start Hadoop services.

	hadoop version

	start-dfs.sh

1. Start Hadoop HDFS services and Ensure there is no existing pending upgrades happening on the system.

	hadoop dfsadmin -upgradeProgress status

	hadoop fs -ls /

	hadoop fs -copyFromLocal /home/hadoop/sample /data/sample

	hadoop dfsadmin -report


2. Maintain the report of the current HDFS 

	hadoop fsck / -files -blocks -locations > dfs-v-old-fsck-1.log
	hadoop dfs -lsr / > dfs-v-old-lsr-1.log
	hadoop dfsadmin -report > dfs-v-old-report-1.log

3. Stop Hadoop services.

	stop-dfs.sh
	
4. Install Hadoop 2.7.2 

5. Ensure you give different port numbers in fs.default.name and other parameters.

6. Start the Upgrade Process
	
		hadoop-daemon.sh start namenode -upgrade  

(This step will only upgrade the index and not the block's metadata)
		
7. Hadoop will start upgrading and will start the namenode service in Safemode 

8. Perform the following command 

	hadoop dfs -lsr / > dfs-v-new-lsr-0.log
	
   and compare with the dfs-v-new-lsr-0.log file
   
9. Start the HDFS clusterr

	start-dfs.sh ( Note that your NameNode service will already be running )

10. You will observe that the Datanodes will start exchanging the block information with the NN and NN will be out of Safemode within 30 seconds subject to the network bandwidth

12. Perform checks

	hdfs dfsadmin -report > dfs-v-new-report-1.log
	hdfs dfs -lsr / > dfs-v-new-lsr-1.log
	
	and compare with the old files.
	
13. Finalize the upgrade using

	hdfs dfsadmin -finalizeUpgrade
